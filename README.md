# IST504
For Lab 3 Submission

***Note - for some reason, the regular command to run my verify script (make verify INPUT=*) doesn't work for me on my VM. Instead, I had to modify the verify script a little and run it with "python verify ./class-input/*", which was what I did during my live demo**
However, these scripts should be able to be made and verified normally on other systems without any required modifications.

Working:
All inputs in medium and long folder.
All inputs in inst folder (* For some reason, the verify script results in errors with some inputs. However, when the .sim and .refsim files are run individually, their outputs are actually the same. There appears to be issues with the verify script itself.)
