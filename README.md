For Lab 3 Submission

***Note - for some reason, the regular command to run my verify script (make verify INPUT=*) doesn't work for me on my VM. Instead, I had to modify the verify script a little and run it with "python verify ./class-input/*", which was what I did during my live demo**
However, these scripts should be able to be made and verified normally on other systems without any required modifications.
